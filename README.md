A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this
tap is available by running:

```bash
tap-mysql --about
```

### Configure using environment variables

This Singer tap will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

### SSH Tunnels (Bastion Hosts)

This tap supports connecting to a Postgres database via an SSH tunnel (also known as a bastion host). This is useful if you need to connect to a database that is not publicly accessible. This is the same as using `ssh -L` and `ssh -R`, but this is done inside the tap itself.

## Usage

You can easily run `tap-mysql` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-mysql --version
tap-mysql --help
tap-mysql --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

Follow these instructions to contribute to this project.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-mysql` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-mysql --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-mysql
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-mysql --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-mysql target-jsonl
```
